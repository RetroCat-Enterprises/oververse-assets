  <h1>SkyBit Lore Terminal Entry ‚Äì IVAN Protocol</h1>
  <p><em>The game you weren‚Äôt meant to survive.</em></p>
  <p>Some say it was just a brutal roguelike. Others say it was a behavioral mapping system for aggression and adaptability in unstable neural environments. But we know the truth: IVAN was not a game. It was a test. A cosmic filter slipped into open-source code to identify the sentient, the ruthless, and the glitch-proof. You were never the player. You were the algorithm being measured. Every death you suffered? Logged. Every decision? Parsed. The ones who reached the end? They were tagged. You won‚Äôt find a playable build. But the Protocol remembers. And it‚Äôs already watching you.</p>
