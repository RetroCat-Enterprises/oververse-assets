  <h1>SkyBit Lore Terminal Entry – Polybius (Hidden Entry 00X)</h1>
  <h2>The Cabinet That Was Never Meant to Exist.</h2>
  <p>First whispered about in the early 2000s, Polybius was allegedly a short-lived arcade game from 1981 that caused nausea, hallucinations, memory loss, and—if you believe the deeper lore—complete neural reprogramming. Only one or two machines were said to exist—always manned by Men in Black. The game vanished within weeks. No screenshots. No code. Just static, rumors, and headaches. Playable here at SkyBit. Don’t worry—it’s probably just a glitchy twin-stick shooter. But first, get yourself an XP Booster at the counter and help keep our dream alive. Because if your brain’s going to melt, it might as well be caffeinated.</p>
